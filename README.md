# ProductPriceTracker_DiscordBOT


A python-based web crawler tool used to track a real-time live feed of product discount from NewEgg and Amazon. The aim is to reduce the need to constantly check product price, and instead more easily keep track of new deals by crawling multiple sources to find the best prices. The data are then to be sent directly through messaging apps, Discord.
